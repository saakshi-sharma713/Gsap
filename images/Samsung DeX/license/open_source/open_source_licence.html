<p>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are <br /> necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when <br /> combined with the Program.</p>
<p>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, <br /> including all Contributors.</p>
<p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>
<p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br /> Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to <br /> reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, <br /> distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such <br /> derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br /> <br /> b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br /> Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed <br /> Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the <br /> Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. <br /> This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the <br /> Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such <br /> addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the <br /> Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations <br /> which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br /> <br /> c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to <br /> its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any <br /> Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual <br /> property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to <br /> Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of <br /> intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the <br /> rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole <br /> responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. <br /> For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to <br /> distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license <br /> before distributing the Program.<br /> <br /> d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright <br /> rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in <br /> this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its <br /> own license agreement, provided that:<br /> <br /> a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and <br /> <br /> b) its license agreement: <br /> i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and <br /> conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title <br /> and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability <br /> and fitness for a particular purpose; <br /> ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for <br /> damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential <br /> damages, such as lost profits; <br /> iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered <br /> by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and <br /> iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such <br /> Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on <br /> or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br /> <br /> a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and <br /> <br /> b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. <br /> Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the <br /> Program.</p>
<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if <br /> any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the <br /> originator of the Contribution.</p>
<p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>
<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with <br /> respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is <br /> intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who <br /> includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner <br /> which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if <br /> a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such <br /> Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify <br /> every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages <br /> and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal <br /> actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the <br /> extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in <br /> connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product <br /> offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses <br /> relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order <br /> to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial <br /> Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to <br /> control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any <br /> related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in <br /> any such claim at its own expense.</p>
<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product <br /> offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that <br /> Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties <br /> related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such <br /> Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the <br /> Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other <br /> Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court <br /> requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial <br /> Contributor must pay those damages.</p>
<p>5. NO WARRANTY</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN <br /> "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR <br /> IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, <br /> NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each <br /> Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and <br /> distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of <br /> rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of <br /> program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, <br /> programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
<p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY <br /> CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, <br /> SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST <br /> PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, <br /> STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY <br /> OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS <br /> GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br /> 7. GENERAL</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable <br /> law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the <br /> terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such <br /> provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such <br /> provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to <br /> a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a <br /> lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient <br /> under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In <br /> addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity <br /> (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program <br /> itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) <br /> infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under <br /> Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to <br /> comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does <br /> not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of <br /> such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, <br /> Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as <br /> reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement <br /> and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and <br /> survive.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in <br /> order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be <br /> modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to <br /> publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. <br /> No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. <br /> IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve <br /> as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the <br /> Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including <br /> Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement <br /> under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement <br /> is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its <br /> Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections <br /> 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the <br /> intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether <br /> expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not <br /> expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the <br /> intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this <br /> Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year <br /> after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in <br /> any resulting litigation.</p>
<p>Special exception for LZMA compression module</p>
<p>Igor Pavlov and Amir Szekely, the authors of the LZMA compression module for NSIS, <br /> expressly permit you to statically or dynamically link your code (or bind by name) <br /> to the files from the LZMA compression module for NSIS without subjecting your linked <br /> code to the terms of the Common Public license version 1.0. Any modifications or additions <br /> to files from the LZMA compression module for NSIS, however, are subject to the terms <br /> of the Common Public License version 1.0.</p>

<p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br /> the version number 2.1.]</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br />not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br />these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br />rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br />you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br />code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br />it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br />there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br />introduced by others.</p>
<p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br />any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br />restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br />ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br />libraries into non-free programs.</p>
<p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br />the library.</p>
<p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br />Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br />libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br />special circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br />a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br />allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br />free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br />system.</p>
<p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br />be combined with the library in order to run.</p>
<p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br /> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br />which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br />straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>
<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br />and installation of the library.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br />writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
<p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br /> complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br /> you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br /> appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br /> all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br /> warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br /> Library.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br />fee.</p>
<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br /> of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br /> distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br /> above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br /> stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br /> charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br /> table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br /> the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br /> is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br /> in the event an application does not supply such function or<br /> table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br /> its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br /> a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br /> application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br /> application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br /> be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br /> root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br />it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />the scope of this License.</p>
<p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br /> License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br /> this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br /> that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br /> instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br /> ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br /> that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br /> these notices.</p>
<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br /> derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br /> under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br /> it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br /> must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br /> medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br /> Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br /> linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a<br /> work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br /> therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br />library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br />work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
<p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br /> link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br /> work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br /> under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br /> modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br /> engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br />this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br />directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br />of these things:</p>
<p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br /> machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br /> changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br /> Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br /> with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br /> uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br /> user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br /> executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br /> that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br /> Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br /> to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br /> Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br /> copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br /> rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br /> will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br /> the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br /> interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>
<p>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br /> least three years, to give the same user the materials<br /> specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br /> than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
<p>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br /> from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br /> specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br /> materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
<p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br />reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br />the executable.</p>
<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br />accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br />distribute.</p>
<p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br /> Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br /> facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br /> library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br /> the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br /> permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
<p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br /> based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br /> facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br /> Sections above.</p>
<p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br /> that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br /> where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
<p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br /> the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br /> attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br /> distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br /> rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br /> or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br /> terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br /> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br /> distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br /> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br /> modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br /> Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br /> all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br /> the Library or works based on it.</p>
<p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br /> Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br /> original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br /> subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br /> restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br /> You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br /> this License.</p>
<p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br /> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br /> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br /> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br /> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br /> distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br /> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br /> may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br /> license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br /> all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br /> the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br /> refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br />implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br /> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br /> original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br /> an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br /> so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br /> excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br /> written in the body of this License.</p>
<p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br /> versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br /> Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br /> but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br />the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br />the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br /> programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br /> write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br /> copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br /> Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br /> decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br /> of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br /> and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
<p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br /> WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br /> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br /> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br /> KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br /> IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br /> PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br /> LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br /> THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br /> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br /> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br /> FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br /> CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br /> LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br /> RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br /> FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br /> SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br /> DAMAGES.</p>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br />everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br />ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p>&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br /> Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br /> modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br /> License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br /> version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br /> but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br /> MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br /> Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br /> License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br /> Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br />necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br /> library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</p>

Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is granted: <br /> 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from <br /> the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the <br /> modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the <br /> Original Code with other software or devices.<br /> <br />2.2. Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims,<br /> each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, <br /> non-exclusive license<br /> <br /> a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)<br /> Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,<br /> sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor <br /> (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other <br /> Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and<br /> b. under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of <br /> Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination<br /> with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, <br /> use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: <br /> 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and <br /> 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its <br /> Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).<br /> c. the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on <br /> the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.<br /> d.

Distribution Obligations. <br /> <br />3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which <br /> You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without<br /> limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be <br /> distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of <br /> this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of <br /> this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may <br /> not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or <br /> restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' <br /> rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document <br /> offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br />3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which <br /> You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms <br /> of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via <br /> an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made <br /> an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic <br /> Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) <br /> months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) <br /> months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has <br /> been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring<br /> that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic <br /> Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br />3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which <br /> You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to <br /> create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a <br /> prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or <br /> indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and <br /> including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and<br /> (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in <br /> which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br />3.4. Intellectual Property Matters <br /> (a) Third Party Claims <br /> If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's <br /> intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted <br /> by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include <br /> a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which <br /> describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail<br /> that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such<br /> knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in <br /> Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all <br /> copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps <br /> (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably <br /> calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new <br /> knowledge has been obtained.<br /> (b) Contributor APIs <br /> If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming <br /> interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are <br /> reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also <br /> include this information in the LEGAL file.<br /> (c) Representations. <br /> Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to <br /> Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's <br /> Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor<br /> has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br />3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file <br /> of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a <br /> particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include <br /> such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would<br /> be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more <br /> Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice <br /> described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any <br /> documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights <br /> or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and<br /> to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations<br /> to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on<br /> Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any <br /> Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, <br /> support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and <br /> You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor <br /> for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor <br /> as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br />3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in <br /> Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 <br /> and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice <br /> stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under<br /> the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You <br /> have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be <br /> conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related <br /> documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights <br /> relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of<br /> Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which <br /> may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in <br /> compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the <br /> Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's <br /> rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this <br /> License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different <br /> license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ <br /> from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer<br /> or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer <br /> and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer<br /> or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br />3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with <br /> other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the <br /> Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the <br /> requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br /> <br />4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. <br /> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License <br /> with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial <br /> order, or regulation then You must: <br /> (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and <br /> (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must <br /> be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included <br /> with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited <br /> by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for<br /> a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<p>5. Application of this License. <br /> This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the<br /> notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p>
<p>6. Versions of the License. <br /> <br />6.1. New Versions <br /> Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised <br /> and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will <br /> be given a distinguishing version number.<br />6.2. Effect of New Versions Once Covered Code has been published under a <br /> particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it <br /> under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered <br /> Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by<br /> Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms <br /> applicable to Covered Code created under this License.<br />6.3. Derivative Works If You create or use a modified version of this License <br /> (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already <br /> Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license <br /> so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", <br /> "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license <br /> (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) <br /> otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms <br /> which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.<br /> (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or <br /> Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves <br /> be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<br /> <br />7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY <br /> COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT <br /> WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT <br /> LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, <br /> MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE <br /> RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. <br /> SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE <br /> INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY <br /> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY <br /> CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED <br /> CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. Termination <br /> <br />8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically <br /> if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach <br /> within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the <br /> Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of <br /> this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect <br /> beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br />8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim <br /> (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a <br /> Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file <br /> such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:<br /> <br /> a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes <br /> any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You <br /> under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice<br /> from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after<br /> receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant <br /> a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of <br /> Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation <br /> claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. <br /> If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement<br /> are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation <br /> claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under <br /> Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the<br /> 60 day notice period specified above.<br /> b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's <br /> Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any<br /> rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)<br /> are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, <br /> distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br /> <br />8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging <br /> that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly <br /> infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or <br /> settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, <br /> then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant <br /> under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the <br /> amount or value of any payment or license.<br />8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user <br /> license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been<br /> validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination <br /> shall survive termination.<br /> <br />9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY <br /> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING <br /> NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY <br /> OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF <br /> ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, <br /> INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br /> LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE <br /> OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF <br /> SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS<br /> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL <br /> INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW <br /> PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR<br /> LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND <br /> LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>10. U.S. government end users <br /> The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 <br /> C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and<br /> "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in <br /> 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 <br /> C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End <br /> Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.</p>
<p>11. Miscellaneous<br /> This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter <br /> hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such <br /> provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it <br /> enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions <br /> (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding<br /> its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least<br /> one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do <br /> business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this <br /> License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the <br /> Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, <br /> California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without <br /> limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The <br /> application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the <br /> International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation <br /> which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against <br /> the drafter shall not apply to this License.</p>
<p>12. Responsibility for claims <br /> As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is <br /> responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of <br /> its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with <br /> Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on <br /> an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to <br /> constitute any admission of liability.</p>
<p>13. Multiple-licensed code <br /> Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as <br /> "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer <br /> permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice <br /> of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial <br /> Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br /> <br />Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.</p>
