<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>General Matters</li>
</ol>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Samsung allows you a licence to use the Software. This means that Samsung does not sell the Software. In addition, all rights that are not expressly identified as yours hereunder shall belong to Samsung or third party Licensors (the &ldquo;Samsung Licensor&rdquo;). Rights offered herein are limited to the intellectual property rights of the Software, and other patent rights or intellectual property rights are not included. You acknowledge and agree that the proprietorship of the Software belongs to Samsung or Samsung Licensors. This Agreement will govern any upgrades to the Software provided by Samsung that replace and/or supplement the original Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate agreement, in which case the terms of that agreement will govern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Licence</li>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are granted a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence, without the right of sublicense to use the Software. You hereby agree to use the Software only on computers and/or mobile devices that you own, lease, or maintain in some other manner, apart from those set forth in Article 3 (Restriction of Licence) of this Agreement. Samsung shall not be responsible for any damages caused by you by (i) making available Software over a network where it could be used by multiple users, or (ii) otherwise using the Software in any unauthorised ways other than those expressly licensed or permitted in this Agreement.</p>

This data will be used to offer Software updates, product support services, and other necessary services, and to confirm that you are using the Software in accordance with this Agreement. Samsung may use such information to upgrade the product, or to offer you services and technical support, so long as you cannot be identified and recognised through the collected information.</p>

<p>To the extent not prohibited under applicable law, Samsung does not provide any warranty related to the accuracy, trustworthiness, or stability of the Software. In addition, Samsung does not hold responsibility for any possible losses from the use of the Software or its disorder, or from any related security violation.

<p>You clearly state and agree that you shall use the Software specified above under your responsibility and also that you are entirely responsible for the satisfaction, performance, accuracy, or effort required and its resulting quality.</p>

<p>Functions in the Software may not satisfy all of your requirements. Errors may occur during the operation of the Software that Samsung may address in an upgrade, in accordance with its programmed modification schedule. However, this does not indicate that it will fix all Software errors. Even if Samsung or the Samsung Licensor offer verbal or written information or advice, this shall not be deemed as a provision or offer to provide any express or implied warranty on the Software.</p>
<p>　</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Limitation of Liability</li>
</ol>
<p>To the maximum extent not prohibited by applicable law, in no way shall Samsung be held liable for any personal injury or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages or loss whatsoever including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or other commercial damage, whether they are sustained from the use of the Software or any errors during this use, or regardless of the root cause that led to such problems. This is applied regardless of legal principles of liability (contracts, torts, or others), or even if SAMSUNG has been informed of a possibility of such damages in advance. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
